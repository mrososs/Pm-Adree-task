## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use **strict mode** in `tsconfig.json`
- Prefer **interfaces** over types for object shapes
- Use **enums** for constants
- Always provide **type annotations** for function parameters and return types
- Use **generic types** when appropriate

### Angular

- Follow the **Angular Style Guide**
- Use **standalone components** when possible
- Implement **OnPush** change detection strategy
- Use **Angular Signals** for state management
- Follow **dependency injection** best practices

### Code Style

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **single quotes** for strings
- Use **semicolons** at the end of statements
- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and interfaces
- Use **kebab-case** for file names

### File Naming

```
Component files: component-name.component.ts
Service files: service-name.service.ts
Interface files: interface-name.interface.ts
Enum files: enum-name.enum.ts
```

### Component Structure

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-component-name",
  templateUrl: "./component-name.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./component-name.component.scss"],
  standalone: true,
  imports: [
    /* imports */
  ],
})
export class ComponentNameComponent implements OnInit {
  // Properties
  public propertyName: string = "";

  // Lifecycle hooks
  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Initialization logic
  }

  // Public methods
  public methodName(): void {
    // Method implementation
  }

  // Private methods
  private privateMethod(): void {
    // Private method implementation
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and services
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows (planned)

### Testing Standards

- Maintain **>80% test coverage**
- Write **descriptive test names**
- Use **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock **external dependencies**
- Test **error scenarios**

### Example Test

```typescript
describe("ComponentNameComponent", () => {
  let component: ComponentNameComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<ComponentNameComponent>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [ComponentNameComponent],
      providers: [
        /* providers */
      ],
    }).compileComponents();

    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ComponentNameComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
  });

  it("should create", () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it("should perform expected action when method is called", () => {
    // Arrange
    const expectedValue = "expected";

    // Act
    const result = component.methodName();

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
  });
});
```
